<p>Immediately after you submit a job, you are brought to the results page. If your job is not yet finished (as will likely be the case when you first come here), it will display a "Please Wait" message. Your results are tied to the URL address of this page. Hence, you may bookmark or otherwise note down the page address, to check on your results at a later time.</p>
<br/>
<span class="ShowIfJavaScript">
	<p>The page has a hidden timer that refreshes the page every minute. So you may leave the page open, and it will refresh itself, until your job is finished, at which point it will display the results. Note however, that this refresh timer requires Javascript to work, so if Javascript is not fully enabled, it may fail to function.</p>
