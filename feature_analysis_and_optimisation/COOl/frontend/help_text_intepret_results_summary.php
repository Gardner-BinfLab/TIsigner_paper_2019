<p>When the algorithm has finished processing your data, it will first show you a summary of all the output sequences of the final generation. (See the <a href="#intepret_results">section above</a> to understand why there may be one or multiple output sequences). But before the summary, there will be 2 links at the top of the page. The first lets you add or remove User Defined Sequences (see <a href="#intepret_results_userdefseq">this section</a> for more details). The second lets you export all the results to a tab seperated TXT file, which shows all the output sequences, and their associated fitness values.</p>
<br/>
<p><b>Important:</b> Jobs will be deleted approximately one month after they were submitted. If you wish to preserve your results, please save it as a TXT file or PDF document.</p>
<br/>
<p>If you have at least 2 of the following Optimization Criteria (IC fitness, CC fitness, CAI, Hidden Stop Codons, GC Content Fitness) the page will also display a graph. This is called a Pareto Plot, but due to the constraints of web interfaces, is limited to only 2 dimensions (instead of however many Optimization Criteria you may have specified). If 3 or more Optimization Criteria were specified, since the graph is compressed onto 2 dimensions, the points may not exhibit a smooth curve, that is typical of Pareto distribution, as the points follow a hyperplane being projected onto 2 dimensional space.</p>
<br/>
<p>Besides the basic 2 dimensions of X and Y axis, the graph can also a indicate a 3rd dimension by colour coding the points. This website uses cyan-red colour coding, which should be readable by most colour blind users.</p>
<br/>
<p>Note that GC Content Fitness, refers to how far the output sequence GC content differs from the user specified target GC content. (E.g. assuming a target GC content of 50%, an output sequence with a GC content of 40%, and another with a GC content of 60%, will both have the same GC Content Fitness of -0.1, indicating a 10% deviation from the desired GC content).</p>
<br/>
<p>Each datapoint on the graph represents an output sequence. Mousing over a datapoint will bring up its fitness value details. These values will appear in one or both of the following:</p>
<table>
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td>&bull;&nbsp;</td>
			<td>Mouse tooltips, or</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>&bull;&nbsp;</td>
			<td>Statistics Table (below the graph title but above the actual chart)</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>
<br/>
<p>Exactly where the values appear depends on Browser compatability. The page has been designed and tested so that at least one of the above will work on most major browsers. Clicking on the output sequence brings you to its details page (see the section on <a href="#intepret_results_details">result details</a> for more information).</p>
<br/>
<p>Note that there are 2 types of datapoints: The optimized sequences generated by our algorithm, and custom sequences which can be added or removed by the user (see <a href="#intepret_results_userdefseq">this section</a> for more details). The user defined sequences use a different symbol (triangle instead of circle) to help them stand out.</p>
<br/>
<p>Immediately below the graph are a set of dropdown boxes. Here, you may select which Optimization Criteria, you want to be plotted on which axis, as well as what values you want to use to colour code the points. Once you have selected your desired options, click the "Redraw Graph" button to the immediate bottom right of the dropdown boxes, to generate a new graph.</p>
<br/>
<p>Note: Because colour coding is not a true axis dimension, we also allow you to plot values, which are not among the normal pareto fitness parameters meant for the X/Y axis. Hence, beyond the usual Optimization Criteria, you may also choose to plot: the GC content (not just the fitness), the number of Exclusion bases, the number of Consecutive Repeat bases, or the number of Repeated Motif bases. (E.g. This can be useful if you want to visualize which of the output sequences have fewer number of repeated motifs).</p>
<br/>
<p>If you have only 1 Optimization Criteria, then the graph (and the dropdown boxes) will be absent. You will only have the summary table instead. Since the algorithm only reports the fittest sequences, if there is only 1 Optimization Criteria, the fittest sequence will be easy to determine, and there will usually only be 1 output sequence as well.</p>
<br/>
<p>The summary table lists the fitness values for each output sequence (both the optimized sequences generated by our algorithm, and the user defined sequences). It is similiar to the exported TXT above, except that it does not include the actual output sequence due to space constraints. This table can be sorted by clicking on its headers, and you can sort by multiple columns, by holding shift while clicking on each header. Clicking on the name of a sequence will lead you to the details page for that output sequence (see the section below).</p>
