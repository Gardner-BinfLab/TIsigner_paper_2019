<p>Sometimes you might want to compare the optimized nucleotide sequences generated by our algorithm, with optimized sequences obtained from other sources. To facilitate this, we allow users to add their own custom User Defined Sequences (UDS) to the list of output sequences. We will calculate the corresponding fitness values for your UDS, and add them to the summary table (and display them on the summary graph as well, if there are at least 2 Optimization Criteria). The "Add/Remove User Defined Sequence Page" is the central point from which you may manage your list of UDS. </p>
<br/>
<p>At the top of the page is the "Add New User Defined Nucleotide Sequence to Results" section. You can add a UDS here, by simply pasting your nucleotide sequence into the textbox, and clicking the "Add Sequence" button (or the "Add And Return to Summary" button). Optionally, you may also specify a name for the UDS, so that you can tell multiple different UDS apart. You can add up to 10 UDS to each job, and once you reach that limit, this section becomes disabled.</p>
<br/>
<p>Below that is the "Delete Existing User Defined Sequences" section. Here, the website displays a table with your current list of UDS, along with their fitness values. You can delete a UDS, simply by clicking on the "Delete" link on the far right column.</p>
