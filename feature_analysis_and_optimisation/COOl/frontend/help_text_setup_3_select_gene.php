<p>You only come to this page, if you opted for "Use Inbuilt Expression Host" in the previous page (Optimization Settings). If you had instead opted to "Input Custom Codon Frequency Values", this page becomes unnecessary, and will be skipped. You will instead be sent directly to the next page (Motif Settings).</p>
<br/>
<p>Here you may select which genes of the Expression Host are included, when calculating the codon (and/or codon pair) frequency values, which will serve as the optimization target. By default (i.e. if you make no changes), we will use all the genes for the Expression Host. Genes here are always referred to by their Locus Tag ID. <span class="ShowIfJavaScript">There are two ways by which you can select genes.</span></p>
<br/>
<p>At the top-most segment of the page is the "Input Quick Gene Selection List" textbox. If you have a list of genes you want to use (e.g. from sorted Gene Expression Data), simply copy and paste it into the textbox, and then click "Select Genes From Text Input", next to the textbox on the lower right. The website will then select all the genes which appear in the textbox, while de-selecting everything else. In the event that a gene ID is not recognized, it will be noted under the "Unrecognized Gene ID List" further below.</p>
<br/>
<p><b>Important:</b> Unlike the other pages, "Input Quick Gene Selection List" is not saved by "Save and Continue". Instead, it is saved by "Select Genes From Text Input".</p>
<br/>
<span class="ShowIfJavaScript">
	<p>The other way is to move genes between the "Selected Genes" and the "Genes Available for Selection" list. Note that you can select genes independently of the "Input Quick Gene Selection List" textbox. Hence you can ignore the "Input Quick Gene Selection List" textbox and just select genes manually.</p>
	<br/>
	<p><b>Important:</b> Additionally, if you have used the "Input Quick Gene Selection List" to quickly select a set of genes, further changes made by manually selecting/deselecting genes will mean that the gene selection no longer follows what was specified in "Input Quick Gene Selection List". If you want to reset the gene selection to what was provided in the textbox, simply click the "Select Genes From Text Input" button again.</p>
