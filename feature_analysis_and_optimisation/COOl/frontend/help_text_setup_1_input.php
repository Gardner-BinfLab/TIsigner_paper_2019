<p>Here, you enter the desired sequence which you wish to optimize. You first select whether you wish to input protein or DNA/RNA sequence. Each has a seperate set of format requirements, which is noted just below the sequence type name.</p>
<br/>
<p>
<span class="HideIfJavaScript">For testing purposes, there are links to the right of the sequence type name. When you click on them, it will open a sample sequence of that type, in a new window. If you wish, you may copy and paste this sample sequence into the input textbox.</span>
<span class="ShowIfJavaScript">For testing purposes, there are buttons to the right of the sequence type name. When you click on them, it will load a sample dataset into the input sequence textbox, and then automatically Save and Continue. These buttons require Javascript to work, and may fail to function if Javascript is not fully enabled. <b>Important:</b> These buttons will overwrite your current input sequence (if any).</span>
</p>
<br/>
<p>If your input is DNA/RNA, you also need to select which set of translation rules applies to your nucleotide input.</p>
<br/>
<p><b>Important:</b> This translation rules you select here, applies to the source organism of the nucleotide sequence, where the DNA/RNA was taken from. Later on, under <a href="#setup_2_method">2: Optimization Settings</a>, you may select another translation rule which applies to the expression host instead. E.g. lets say you are trying to express a <i>Blepharisma</i> nucleotide sequence in <i>Salmonella bongori</i> (which uses Standard translation rules). Then here, you should select "<i>Blepharisma Nuclear Code</i>".</p>
<br/>		
<p>Optionally, you may also enter a title for the current sequence, which will be included in the output results. This might be useful, if you are submitting several jobs at once, and you wish to keep track of which result belongs to which job. When you are done, click "Save and Continue".</p>
<br/>
<p>If you are initially submitting a new sequence, the link tabs for the other steps (2-5) are greyed out and inactive. These other setup pages only become available, after you first save a sequence. After the initial step of saving a sequence, but before you Submit the job, you may still return to this "1: Input Sequence" page to edit your sequence and/or title.</p>
<br/>
<p>If you are just submitting a job for testing purposes, note that this is the ONLY page that requires user input. The rest of the pages either provide options which come with some reasonable default selection (e.g. target species is initially set to <i>Escherichia coli</i> by default), or have inputs which are entirely optional (e.g. exclusion nucleotides). Hence, beyond this page, for the rest of the job submission process, you can just click "Save and Continue" without changing anything, all the way until the job has been submitted.</p>
