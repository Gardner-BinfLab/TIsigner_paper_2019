The "codonopt-job_manager.pl" script should be run after setting up the MySQL database.

The back-end "co_ubuntu.exe" algorithm can be run as an independent tool.
"co_ubuntu.exe" is an executable binary compiled to run on a Linux x86 (64-bit) environment.
It requires an input file named "X_param", where "X" is the serial number for a user's job on the database.
"X_param" is a 2-column tab-delimited file containing the following parameters:
- encryptID: Encrypted ID for the user job
- aaSeq: Protein sequence to be optimized
- flagHash: A semicolon-delimited list indicating the objectives to be optimized
- gcTarget: The target GC content % value to achieve
- exclSeqList: Sequences to be excluded for the optimization
- repeatNum: Length and number of repeats to be avoided
- c2aa: Codon to amino acid translation rule
- aa2c: Amino acid to codon reverse translation rule
- cPair2aaPair: Codon pair to amino acid pair translation rule
- cCountRef: Codon counts of reference organism
- aaCountRef: Amino acid counts of reference organism
- cPairCountRef: Codon pair counts of reference organism
- aaPairCountRef: Amino acid pair counts of reference organism
- GArunParam: 
- randSeed: 

The output file "X_results" containing a list of optimized sequences and
their respective fitness values in the order of IC, CC, CAI, Exclusion Sequence, 
GC fitness, Hidden Stop Codons, Repeat Fitness will be generated.

See "0000000077_param" and "0000000077_results" for example.
